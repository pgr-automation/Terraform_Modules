**Details:**
- Ensures the configuration files are syntactically valid.
- Does not validate correctness against real resources.

---

## 3. `terraform plan`
**Purpose:** Generates and displays an execution plan.  
**Details:**
- Determines changes needed to achieve the desired state.
- Does not execute changes.
- **Options:**
  - `-out=plan.out`: Saves the plan to a file for later use with `apply`.
  - `-destroy`: Creates a plan to destroy all resources.
  - `-var="key=value"`: Overrides variables.

**Details:**
- Subcommands:
  - `list`: Lists all resources in the state file.
  - `mv`: Moves resources within the state file.
  - `pull`: Downloads the state file from the backend.
  - `rm`: Removes resources from the state file.
  - `show`: Displays resource details.

---

## 10. `terraform import`
**Purpose:** Imports an existing resource into the Terraform state.  
**Details:**
- Requires manual configuration for imported resources.

---

## 11. `terraform taint` (Deprecated)

- Replaced by `terraform apply -replace`.

---

## 12. `terraform untaint`

---

## 17. `terraform version`
**Purpose:** Displays the installed version of Terraform and provider versions.  

---

## 18. `terraform graph`
**Purpose:** Generates a dependency graph of resources in DOT format.  
**Details:**
- Can be visualized using tools like Graphviz.

---

## 19. `terraform force-unlock`
**Purpose:** Manually unlocks a Terraform state file locked by another operation.  
**Details:**
- Use cautiously to avoid conflicts.

---

## 20. `terraform debug`
